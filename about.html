<p> 	According to many American History scholars like Ben Shapiro, the formation of an independent American government was a turning point in the history of the world and laid the foundation for the greatest and most powerful nation ever to grace the face of the Earth. But what is not so known is that the American government created in 1776 took a lot of ideas and policies from the previous governing nation, the British. The founders of our nation had lived a life under the tyranny of the British government and knew every spot and crevice of the British government. They used this knowledge to form their very own government but made a lot of key changes from the British governing system. According to Independence Hall Association in Philadelphia, â€œAccording to Locke, a ruler gains authority through the consent of the governed. The duty of that government is to protect the natural rights of the people, which Locke believed to include life, liberty, and property. (UShistory.org 2006, p. 1). Locke believed that governments did not have the responsibility of controlling many of the aspect of everyday life. In other words he believed in limited government and the idea of governing by consent. </p>
